# Simple_Game
This is a Text Based Adventure Game. Once you run it, you will have 2 different GUI's opened at the same time. Once the story takes up all the space of the story window, it will automatically close it and open a new one, so choose carefully and read through the story. One GUI will be based on user input. Write on that GUI to insert a choice given to you in the adventure and click anywhere inside that GUI to continue on! The Story will be shown on another GUI with a couple outcomes. Choose the correct one for the longest outcome in which you will see narrative on the third and final GUI. The third and final GUI has many outcomes so keep playing around to see what you get. I tried to have and image
pop up whenever you died but I havent learned that or found a way to do it yet. But its ok, what matters is that you have fun. Thank You!
